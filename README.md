Rust_Vulkan_Stuff
--

This application is mainly for self-learning and exploration of the world of Rust.

While implementing I try to:
 - Write ~~safe~~unsafe rust code
 - Take design decisions as if they were for a ~~larger~~smaller codebase
 - ~~Not~~ cheat in implementations ... too much


Since I wrote this the first time I have changed my mind.
New goals:
- Implement towards gfx-rs
- The current goal is oriented towards a particle system
  - The goal itself is not the particle system, but rather I use the particle system as an excuse of learning the language.

Since this became a log of the project anyways, some more changes have happened:
- Implement vulkan with ash
- More of a focus on scene loading with assets.
- Try to work towards an engine-esque type of code, with an application as a wrapping layer of a "scene"
